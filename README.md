# Solution.Hotel.Remake
 Our hotel reservation project, which we have done during the training, has been rearranged in order to improve the complexity of coding and performance.
 Changes;
1. Variable names
2. Calling the codes in the event using methods instead of writing too much code in the event
3. Making class content appropriate for the content
